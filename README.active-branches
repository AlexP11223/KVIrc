no_embedded_lib_code:
    Purpose:
    ********
    This branch has the target to either remove embedded copies of third-party
    code (in this regard: code/functionality that can be found in a library)
    entirely or at least open up a build path, where the library is used.

    Rationale:
    **********
    The reasons for this work are simple: security, robustness and
    (compilation) speed.
    Embedded copies of code or the nth reimplementation of code might be a
    feasable solution on systems without package management or a good way
    to exercise one programming skills, but lead all invariently to the
    problems named above. This is most often due to the fact, that embedded
    code doesn't stay in sync with the original upstream version and thus
    misses security fixes or the fact, that the own reimplementation of some
    functionality isn't tested as widely the one offered by a library. That
    allows security issues staying unsolved for a long time.

    Additional Note:
    ****************
    The Debian Security Team dislikes embedded code (for reasons see above),
    therefore I'm trying to get us rid of them.
